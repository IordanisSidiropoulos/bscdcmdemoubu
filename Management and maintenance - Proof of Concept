# Created “touch” files into each directory after assigning users to groups and the groups to directories.

# “Getfacl (file name)”: get info about access permissions of each file
# “Setfacl: -m g:(group name):(permissions) (directory name)” Created a new directory called “onlyharis” and changed its permissions

# Logged in with user “nikos” and I managed to created a file in “onlyharisdir”. That is because a gave permission to group “greek” to write files. So every user belonging to that group will eventually be able to write files in that dir.
# “Mv (old name) (new name)”: changing name of a file. “Onlyharis” was changed to “norock” since the only owner group denied is “rock”
